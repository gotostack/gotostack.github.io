What is OpenStack
=================

**Open source software for creating private and public clouds.**

OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a `dashboard <http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-dashboard/>`_ or via the `OpenStack API <http://developer.openstack.org/>`_. OpenStack works with `popular enterprise and open source technologies <http://openstack.org/marketplace/drivers/>`_ making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure.

`Hundreds of the world's largest brands <http://openstack.org/user-stories/>`_ rely on OpenStack to run their businesses every day, reducing costs and helping them move faster. OpenStack has a strong `ecosystem <http://openstack.org/foundation/companies/>`_, and users seeking commercial support can choose from different OpenStack-powered products and services in the `Marketplace <http://openstack.org/marketplace/>`_.

The software is built by a `thriving community <http://openstack.org/community/>`_ of developers, in collaboration with users, and is designed in the open at our `Summits <http://openstack.org/summit/>`_.
